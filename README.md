**# Speech-Recognition-System**

Overview:
In this task, you will develop a basic Speech-to-Text system using existing pre-trained models and speech processing libraries. The goal is to convert spoken audio input into accurate textual representation, mimicking the kind of voice-to-text functionality used in virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. This task is a fundamental application of Artificial Intelligence and falls under the domain of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), a critical subfield of AI with real-world implications.

**#Objective:**
Build a functional system that is capable of:

Accepting a short audio file (e.g., WAV or MP3 format)

Processing the file using an ASR model or library

Transcribing the spoken content into text

Outputting the transcription in a readable format (console, text file, or UI)

The expected outcome is a working prototype of a speech-to-text converter that leverages modern libraries or APIs.

**Technical Scope:**

To accomplish this task, you can use the following tools/libraries:

Python as the main programming language

SpeechRecognition library (Python) – a wrapper over multiple ASR engines like Google Web Speech API, Sphinx, etc.

Wave module or pydub – for audio processing and manipulation

transformers + torchaudio – for advanced models like wav2vec 2.0, developed by Facebook AI

Librosa – for advanced audio signal processing (optional)

Additionally, you may explore open-source pretrained models available through HuggingFace or Google Cloud Speech-to-Text APIs for more robust performance.

**Deliverables:**

A fully functional Python script or Jupyter Notebook

Ability to take a short audio clip (duration: 5–20 seconds) as input

Clear transcription output on console or stored as a .txt file

Proper error handling (e.g., unsupported formats, empty audio, or background noise)

Well-commented code for clarity and review

Screenshots or logs showing the input and output behavior

Optionally, a simple user interface (CLI/GUI) is a bonus

**Learning Outcomes:**

By completing this task, you will gain practical experience in:

Understanding how automatic speech recognition systems work

Working with audio files and digital signal processing in Python

Using open-source AI libraries for real-world applications

Interacting with machine learning models without training from scratch

Preprocessing audio signals for cleaner, more accurate recognition

Handling real-world input issues like accents, speed, or noise

Thinking about the ethical and accessibility implications of voice-driven tech

This task will enhance your confidence in using AI tools and set a solid foundation for more advanced applications like voice-controlled bots, intelligent assistants, and multilingual speech systems.

**Use Case Examples:**

Transcribing lecture recordings or interviews

Real-time voice command processing

Captioning systems for media content

Voice-to-text input methods for differently-abled users
